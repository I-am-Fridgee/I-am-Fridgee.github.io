  <design_movement>Cyberpunk Neon Noir</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **High Contrast & Glow**: Deep blacks paired with neon pinks, cyans, and purples to mimic a futuristic night city.
    2. **Glitch & Distortion**: Subtle digital artifacts and chromatic aberration to emphasize the "hacker/underground" vibe.
    3. **Information Density**: HUD-like overlays and data streams for game stats (coins, chips).
    4. **Immersive Depth**: Layered semi-transparent panels with blurred backdrops (glassmorphism) to create a sense of 3D space.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    Uses a "Midnight City" palette. The deep black background represents the infinite potential of the night, while neon accents act as beacons of excitement and risk. It evokes the thrill of a high-stakes, underground cyber-casino.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Asymmetric HUD**: The main clicker is off-center, surrounded by floating "widgets" for the shop, stats, and mini-games. Navigation feels like interacting with a futuristic terminal rather than a standard webpage.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Neon Borders**: Pulsing borders that react to clicks and wins.
    2. **Scanlines**: Faint, moving horizontal lines overlaying the background.
    3. **Holographic Icons**: Shop items and game icons look like projected holograms.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Tactile Feedback**: Every click triggers a visual "shockwave" or digital ripple. Buttons have a "press-down" mechanical feel with immediate lighting changes.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    Fast, snappy transitions with "glitch" effects on state changes. Coins "digitize" into the counter rather than just flying.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Display**: 'Orbitron' or 'Rajdhani' for headers (futuristic, angular).
    **Body**: 'Share Tech Mono' or 'Roboto Mono' for stats and logs (terminal style).
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Art Deco Gatsby Luxury</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Opulence & Gold**: Heavy use of gold leaf textures, geometric patterns, and rich velvets (deep reds/greens).
    2. **Symmetry & Geometry**: Strong vertical lines, sunburst motifs, and sharp angles characteristic of the 1920s.
    3. **Elegant Typography**: Focus on high-contrast serif fonts and intricate borders.
    4. **Materiality**: UI elements should feel like physical cards, heavy chips, and polished wood.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    "Roaring Wealth". Black and Gold dominance signifies exclusivity and premium status. Deep emerald green accents for the "money" feel. It makes the player feel like a high-roller in a private VIP lounge.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **The Stage**: The game area is framed like a theater stage or a grand entrance. The clicker is the "star" in the center, with curtains or pillars framing the side panels (shop, games).
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Gold Foil Textures**: Gradients that mimic metallic reflection on headers and buttons.
    2. **Geometric Frames**: Complex, decorative borders around every game section.
    3. **Velvet Backgrounds**: Subtle noise textures on dark backgrounds to simulate fabric.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Smooth & Heavy**: Animations are slow and eased (ease-in-out). Chips "clack" and slide. Cards flip with weight. It feels expensive, not arcade-y.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    Elegant fades and slides. Wins trigger a "shower" of gold sparks or confetti that falls gently like snow.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Display**: 'Playfair Display' or 'Cinzel' (high contrast, elegant).
    **Body**: 'Montserrat' (clean geometric sans to balance the ornate headers).
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Vaporwave Retro Arcade</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Pastel Nostalgia**: Soft pinks, mint greens, and baby blues mixed with wireframe 3D grids.
    2. **Lo-Fi Aesthetic**: Pixel art icons, CRT monitor curvature effects, and 80s/90s tropical vibes.
    3. **Surrealism**: Floating marble busts, palm trees, and dolphins mixed with casino elements.
    4. **Playfulness**: The design doesn't take itself too seriously; it's about "chill vibes" and fun.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    "Sunset Boulevard". A gradient of sunset colors (purple to orange) creates a relaxing, hypnotic atmosphere. It counters the stress of gambling with a soothing, dreamlike aesthetic.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Windows 95 Desktop**: Game modules (Clicker, Shop, Blackjack) open as draggable "windows" or floating cards on a 3D grid background.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Grid Horizon**: A perspective grid floor fading into a sunset sun.
    2. **Pixelated UI**: Buttons look like chunky, bevelled Windows 95 controls or arcade cabinets.
    3. **Kanji & Glitch**: Occasional Japanese text or VHS static overlays for style.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Bouncy & Arcade**: Clicks have a "squash and stretch" effect. Sounds are 8-bit synths. Everything feels responsive and game-y.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    Constant gentle floating (sine wave motion) for idle elements. Retro "scanline" wipes for transitions.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Display**: 'Press Start 2P' or 'VCR OSD Mono' (pixel/retro).
    **Body**: 'Karla' or 'Space Grotesk' (quirky sans-serif).
  </typography_system>
